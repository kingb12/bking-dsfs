A repository for worked examples and experiments from reading [Data Science from Scratch](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781492041122/)

In [`/notebooks`](https://github.com/kingb12/bking-dsfs/tree/master/notebooks) I've created a Jupyter notebook for each chapter I've worked through, with notes for my own understanding.

In the root directory are python modules factored out from these notebooks, including any of the re-usable parts (many problems require functions defined in a previous chapter).
